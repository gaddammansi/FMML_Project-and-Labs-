        "#Answer:\n",
        "You can see that the first 2 principal components were able to differentiate the benign and malignant tumours in our breast cancer dataset. This motivates the use of the second application of PCA, which was to reduce the number of features in the dataset so that the machine learning algorithm can be trained without overfitting."
